What and why
------------

This project is based on the [activetagindicatorbar patch], which
looks like this:

<div align='center'>

![activetagindicatorbar image sample](activetagindicatorbar.png)

</div>

[activetagindicatorbar patch]: https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/activetagindicatorbar/

It's a cool way to personalize the occupied monitor but it fails in
terms of customization:

- [ ] Customize bar height
- [ ] Customize bar color
- [ ] Customize bar border
- [ ] Customize bar padding _(from tag sides)_

So, I've decided to implement all of these features, turning vanilla
**DWM** into a more _'[riceable]'_ environment!

Then, the default patch implementation will looks like this: _(take a
look to [customization])_
